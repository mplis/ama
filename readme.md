# Ask me anything!

I think a public AMA is a great way to share knowledge. A lot of questions answered in private could just as easily be answered in public, and the answer could be shared with everyone.

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite.

*You can also reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mikeplis) if you'd prefer to ask your question in private, but just know that I'm likely to give more in-depth answers on a public medium like this.*
